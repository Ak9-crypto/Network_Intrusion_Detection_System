Step 4: Identify Network Interface
"ifconfig"


Example interface: enp0s3

Step 5: Configure Snort

Test Snort configuration:

"" sudo snort -T -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i enp0s3  ""


Run Snort in IDS mode:
""
sudo snort -A console -q -u snort -g snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i enp0s3
""
🔍 Attack Simulation & Testing
Port Scanning Attack (Nmap)
""
nmap -sV <Server_IP>
""
DoS Attack (Slowloris)
""
slowloris <Server_IP>
""

Snort will generate alerts upon detecting these attacks.
